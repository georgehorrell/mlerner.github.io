title: "CS Conferences in 2022"
categories:

With a few days left in 2021, I found some time to put together a preliminary list of conferences on my "watch list" for next year. It doesn't cover everything and I would love suggestions via email (email address is my name at gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/micahlerner).

I've added a few new conferences to the list [from 2021](/2021/08/14/systems-conferences-2021.html). The new conferences are mostly related to machine learning, programming languages, and cryptography - I want to branch out and read more papers not from "my area" of computer science.

I also certainly won't be able to read every paper from the conferences below, but I will try to keep with a regular (~weekly) posting schedule like the one I had in 2021!
