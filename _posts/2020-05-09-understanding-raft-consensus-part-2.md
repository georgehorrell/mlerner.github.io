## Leaders and leader election
The Raft protocol requires a single node (called the __Leader__) to direct other nodes on how they should change their respective states of the world. There can only be one leader at a time - Raft maintains a representation of time called a `term`. This term only changes in special situations, like when a node attempts to become a `Leader`.
When a Raft cluster starts, there are no leaders and one needs to be chosen through a process called __Leader Election__ before the cluster can start responding to requests. 

### How does the leader election process work?
A node starts the leader election process by designating itself to be a `Candidate`, incrementing its term, voting for itself, and requesting the votes of other nodes in the Raft cluster using `RequestVote`. 

There are a few ways that a node can exit `Candidate` state:
- If the `Candidate` node receives a majority of votes within some configurable time period of the election starting, it becomes the leader. 
- If the `Candidate` node doesn't receive a majority of votes within some configurable time period of the election starting (and it hasn't heard from another leader, as in the case below), the node restarts the election (including incrementing its term and and sending out `RequestVote` communications again).
- If the `Candidate` (Node A) hears from a different peer (Node B) who claims to be `Leader` for a term greater than or equal to the term that Node A is on, Node A stops its election, sets its term to Node B's, enters the `Follower` state, and begins listening for updates from the `Leader`. 
	
Once a node becomes a `Leader`, it begins sending communications in the form of `AppendEntries` (discussed more in the next section) messages to all other peers, and will continue trying to do so unless it hears about a different `Leader` with a higher term (you may be wondering how Raft ensures that a `Leader` with an out of date state of the world doesn't somehow acquire a higher term, but that topic is covered in the `Safety` section). 

To allow Raft to recover from a `Leader` failing (maybe because of an ethernet unplugging scenario), an up to date `Follower` can kick off an election.

I found the visualization in the margin (from the original Raft paper) to be helpful for thinking about the ways that a node can transition between the three possible states of `Follower`, `Candidate`, and `Leader`.

## Raft logs and replication

### What is an AppendEntries request and what information does it contain?
As mentioned above, `Leader` nodes periodically send `AppendEntries` messages to `Follower` nodes to let the `Follower`s know that there is still an active `Leader`. 
These `AppendEntries` calls also serve the purpose of helping to update out of date `Follower`s with correct data to store in their logs.
The information that the leader supplies in the calls is as follows:
- __The `Leader's` current term -__ as mentioned in the **Leaders and leader election** section, if a node is a `Candidate` or a `Leader`, hearing about a new or existing leader might require the node to take some action (like giving up on an election or stepping down as a _Leader_). 
- __Log entries__ (represented as an array) that the __Leader__ wants to propagate to peers, along with data about the `Leader's` log that will help the `Follower` make a decision about what to do with the new entries. In particular, the `Leader` sends data about the log entry that immediately preceded the entries it is sending. Because the data pertains to the previous log entry, the names of the variables are __previousLogIndex__ and __previousLogTerm__.  {% marginfigure 'leader-log' 'https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMivsh%2FJ67QQC2tnw.png?alt=media&token=85f3bb55-1a92-4c85-bf89-804728cca996' 'Leader log' %} For an example of how these variables are assigned, consider a Leader's log as shown in the margin. If the leader wanted to update the follower with entries that are in positions 9 through 10, it would include those in the __log entries__ section of the `AppendEntries` call, setting __previousLogIndex__ to 8 and __previousLogTerm__ to 6.
     
- The `Leader's` __commitIndex__: this is where the idea of **committing** from the earlier part of this guide comes into play. 

### What happens when a peer receives an AppendEntries request?
Once a peer receives an `AppendEntries` request from a leader, it evaluates whether it will need to update its state, then responds with its current term as well as whether it successfully processed the request:
-  **If the receiving node has a greater term than the sending node**, the receiving node ignores the `AppendEntries` request and immediately communicates to the sending node that the request failed. This has the effect of causing the sending node to step down as a leader. A situation where this could arise is when a `Leader` is disconnected from the network, a new election succeeds (with a new term and Leader), then the old Leader is reconnected. Because Raft only allows one leader at a time, the old one should step down. 
- **If the receiving node has an equal term as the sending node, a few conditions need to be evaluated:**
Firstly, if the receiving node is not a `Follower`, it should immediately transition to being one. This behavior serves to notify candidates for the term that a `Leader` has been elected, as well as guarding against the existence of two `Leaders`. Hitting this condition does not cause the `AppendEntries` request to return.
	- **Once it has been checked that the receiving and sending nodes have the same term, we need to make sure that their logs match.** This check is performed by looking at the __previousLogIndex__ and __previousLogTerm__ of the sending node and comparing to the receiving node's log. 
As part of performing this check, a few scenarios arise.
		- __In the match case__, the __previousLogIndex__ and __previousLogTerm__ of the sending node match the entry in the receiving node's log, meaning that everything is up to date! If this is true, the receiving node can add the received entries to its log. The receiving node also checks whether the `Leader` has a newer commit index (meaning that the receiving node is able to update its commit index and apply messages that will affect its state)
		- If the log for a `Follower` is not up to date, the Leader will keep decrementing the __previousLogIndex__ for the `Follower` and keep retrying the request until the logs match (the match case above is true) or it has been determined that all entries in the `Follower` need to be replace

## Raft Safety
At the core of Raft are guarantees about safety that make sure that data in the log isn't corrupted or lost. For example, imagine that a `Leader` starts coordinating changes to the log, does so successfully, then goes offline. While the existing `Leader` is offline, a new `Leader` is elected and the system continues updating the log. If the old `Leader` were to come back online, how can we make sure that it isn't able to rewind the system's log? 

To account for this situation (and all of the edge cases that can occur in distributed systems), Raft aims to implement several ideas around Safety. A few of these we've already touched on (descriptions are from Figure 3 of the original Raft paper):
-  **Election Safety:** "There can at most be one leader at a time." Discussed in **Leaders and leader election**. 
- **Leader Append-Only:** "a leader never overwrites or deletes entries in its log; it only appends new entries." The leader never mutates it's internal logs. Discussed in **Raft logs and replication**.
- **Log Matching**: "if two logs contain an entry with the same index and term, then the logs are identical in all entries up through the given index." If the leader doesn't have logs that match followers, the leader will rewind the follower's log entries, then send over the correct data. Discussed in **Raft logs and replication**.

The other important ideas around Raft Safety are:
- **Leader Completeness**: "if a log entry is committed in a given term, then that entry will be present in the logs of the leaders for all higher-numbered terms". The gist of this principle is to ensure that a leader has all log entries that should be stored permanently (**committed**) by the system. To make the idea of Leader Completeness concrete, imagine a situation where a key-value store performs a put and then a delete - if the put operation was replicated, but the delete happened in a higher term and is not in the log of the leader, the state of the world will be incorrect, as the delete will not be processed. To ensure that leaders aren't elected with stale logs, a node that receives a `RequestVote` must check that the sender has a log where the last entry is of a greater term or of the same term and of a higher index. If the receiver determines that neither of those conditions is true, then it rejects the request.
- **State Machine Safety**:  "if a server has applied a log entry at a given index to its state machine, no other server will ever apply a different log entry for the same index." The gist of this principle is to ensure that a leader applies entries from its log in the correct order. To make the idea of State Machine Safety concrete, imagine a situation where a key-value store performs a put and then a delete (both of which are stored in individual log entries). If the put operation was applied, then the delete operation was applied, every other node must perform the same sequence of applications. A more detailed explanation of the proof is available in the Raft paper.
