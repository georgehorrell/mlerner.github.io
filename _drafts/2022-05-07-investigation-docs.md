When working on a large and complex technical project at the early stages, I've found it hard to ship out a design doc{% sidenote 'design' "While some folks think design docs aren't necessary, I think that having something written down about a project's details is very helpful to share so that others can quickly get up to speed on what you are thinking about and why."%}.

Designs can be difficult to write, espescially at the research stage, when you're not yet sure which direction the project will go. To combat this feeling, I copied a pattern I saw other folks following, which I call an "investigation doc".

Design docs are difficult to write because...

- early stage projects don't have a clear path immediately
- a full design can be too monolithic -> bad because don't get feedback
- design docs can come across as saying "this is the answer", rather than "this is what I think the answer is" -> change in attitude of

What is in one?

- problem statement -> what are we actually trying to solve and why?
- FAQ -> if you talk to people about what you are working on, write down their questions and try to answer them
- status (if you are prototyping, links to code)
- current understanding -> potential approaches you've explored

Pros:

- ship something incrementally -> get feedback
- have some way to explain what current state is

Cons:

- require being humble and accepting that you might not know everything, can be difficult if your team doesn't have psych safety
