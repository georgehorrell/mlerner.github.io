[Noria: dynamic, partially-stateful data-flow for high-performance web applications](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/noria:osdi18.pdf) Gjengset, Schwarzkopf, et al. OSDI 2018

I started reading this paper after I started following the work of [Jon Gjengset](TODO) - he has great streams about Rust (in particular, I have been enjoying [Crust of Rust](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqbS7AVVErFiWDOAVrPt7aYmnuuOLYvOa), where he goes over intermediate Rust topics). 

## What is Noria?
The Noria paper outlines a system that could replace a traditional two-tier architecture used in web applications to serve high read request volume. 

{% maincolumn 'assets/noria/two-tier.png' 'Classic two tier architecture' %}

This two-tier architecture uses a backing database and a cache (like Memcached, Redis, etc.) to limit the number of requests that hit the backing database. Putting a cache in front of the database to serve read requests raises several important questions:
- How is the cache invalidated when a write is made to the backing datastore? Presumably, the cache should be invalidated when a write happens, but how does one make sure that cache invalidations don't happen all at once (an event that could overload your cache system, knocking it offline).
- How is the cache set up to handle changes in user patterns? For example, say that the cache only has a subset of popular records, but traffic suddenly shifts to a different set of records (imagine that a different set of videos go viral).

Another challenge with a traditional two-tier architecuture is being able to handle aggregations well - for example, say that you wanted to maintain the top-k posts on a site, or the min/max of a set of values. These types of aggregations are supported by current stream processing systems, with a caveat - the stream processing systems often perform aggregations over a window of time to limit the data that needs to be retained.

## Data Flow

The Noria paper proposes a new database (including an [implementation](https://github.com/mit-pdos/noria)), that aims to support "read-heavy applications that tolerate eventual consistency"

In order to achieve the goal of getting rid of an external cache, Noria has:
- Base tables (a persistent store of the database state)
- Derived views ("the data that an application might choose to cache")

Base tables are accessed via derived views, which can be internal or external. These derived views are populated using base tables, then are modified using **data flow** - operations on the database like writes, updates, and deletes _flow_ through a graph that contains state. 
{% sidenote 'data flow' 'The paper points to past research on data-flow systems, like [Naiad: A Timely Dataflow System](https://cs.stanford.edu/~matei/courses/2015/6.S897/readings/naiad.pdf).'%}. Similarly, if the backing data for a derived view is not in cache, it will be fetched using an **upquery**.

{% maincolumn 'assets/noria/data-flow.png' 'Data flow example' %}

The nodes in the graph are views of the database used by readers, or cached intermediate results used to build those views. The state represented by the graph is updated in response to operations (writes, updates, deletes, evictions). Similarly, the edges can represent relationships between intermediate results - for example, if a derived view relies on two tables, there would be edges between the intermediate results and the output derived view. Interestingly, related derived views (views that use the same underlying tables) can **reuse** the graph of state. 

The idea of representing derived views as a graph of intermediate results comes in handy when new user patterns emerge or new derived tables are added. In this situation, Noria will _transition_ to a new graph of data-flow: 
> Noria first plans the transition, reusing operators and state of existing expressions where possible (ยง5.1). It then incrementally applies these changes to the data-flow, taking care to maintain its correctness invariants (ยง5.2). Once both steps complete, the application can use new tables and queries. 

The paper argues that this transitioning pattern is fundamentally different than existing data-flow systems, which can not perform updates to the graph on the fly (or without a restart).

To ensure that the size of the data in the derived views does not have unbounded growth, Noria implements _partially_ stateful data-flow - 
if the footprint of the derived views grows to be too large, the system evicts data intelligently 
(a user of the system need to ensure enough resources are provided so that there is not significant churn in the data kept in cache).
{% sidenote 'materialized views' 'The paper mentions that partial materialization is not entirely new, but that applying the idea to "data-flow" systems is.'%}. Similarly, if the backing data for a derived view is not in cache, it will be fetched using an **upquery**.
